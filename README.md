# rpi-camera-apps
Raspberry Pi apps that use the camera module

## Support
- Not compatible with Python2.
- Compatible with Raspbian Buster, and requires the Picamera module.
- Has not been tested on Raspbian Bullseye due to deprecation of Picamera. I hope to migrate to Bullseye once Picamera2 has a stable release.
